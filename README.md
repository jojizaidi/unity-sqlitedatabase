# unity-sqlitedatabase

A basic starter project to get started with Unity3d and Sqlite databases. Can be used in a variety of ways. To handle inventory, player management, chat servers, etc.

- To create your own database use [Sqlite Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org)
- Always place your database in the Streaming Assets folder in the Unity3d project
- Your database will be copied to the Application.persistentDataPath when you run the project
- The project contains a very basic read and insert query. Though it supports all Sqlite queries. Feel free to contact me if you get stuck somewhere.
